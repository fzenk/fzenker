Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of English Linguistics at TU Braunschweig. My research is primarily concerned with investigating how learners (a) develop implicit knowledge about the morphosyntax of a nonnative language and (b) process sentences in that language in real time. I have experience teaching courses on general linguistics and second language acquisition to both undergraduate and graduate students. I also have a strong background in teaching English to speakers of other languages.
